# Algolia BestBuy Search

This is a demo of Algolia using the BestBuy ecommerce sample dataset. This was a fun project!

This project uses Vite, React, and Tailwind to get a clean, professional front end up and running quickly. It is hooked up to my Algolia account. The dataset being used is the Algolia sample ecommerce dataset containing 10,000 BestBuy SKUs. The intended purpose of the demo is to showcase Algolia's capabilities in providing an enjoyable and easy-to-use user experience for searching across vast ecommerce data.

In particular, this experience provides:
- Full-text search with typo tolerance and relevance tuning
- Faceted navigation (category, brand, product type, price range, shipping)
- Business-aware ranking (popularity, review volume, price)
- Multiple sort orders using Algolia replica indices

The UI is built using:
- React + Algolia InstantSearch
- Tailwind CSS
- Search bar
- Faceted sidebar
- Sort controls
- Result cards with imagery, pricing, and metadata

I wanted to design a real consumer grade search experience for this demo. Let me know what you think!
